## To Run This Project

**Through the console**
```bash
# clone repo through the terminal
git clone https://github.com/coletucker12/random-project.git
cd random-project/ # change into project directory
npm install # install the npm packages
npm run dev # run server in development

```
- ***Note:*** this method is using bash (i.e. not windows CMD or powershell) and requires git as well as npm already installed
 


## Ideas
- Add Project Ideas Here:

### Below are links to resources I use to code
- **VSCode**: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - I use VSCode as my main code editor for all languages, you can install plugins for pretty much any programming language, themes, etc. It also comes with integrated git control and an integrated terminal (which I never use).
  - Other options: Sublime, Atom, etc.
- **Cmder**: https://cmder.net/ 
  - I use cmder as a Command Prompt replacement for windows because windows CMD is trash
- **WSL (w/ Ubuntu)**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10
  - Windows Subsystem Linux lets you have a linux partition without the hastle of dual booting, so you can remotely connect to and use the linux filesystem which tends to work way better than windows, because bash > all
- **DataGrip**: https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/
  - This is part if the IdeaProjects suite, they have abunch of full fledged IDE's that are awesome, but datagrip is the best for messing with databases
- **SourceTree**: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
  - I don't personally use this, but its a great UI for Git, helps with git flow if using the terminal isn't for you

### Below are links to resources used for developing with nuxt.js and vuetify
- **Nuxt.js** (Server Framework): https://nuxtjs.org/
- **Vue.js** (Frontend Framework): https://vuejs.org/
- **Vuetify.js** (UI Components): https://vuetifyjs.com/en/
- **Axios** (JavaScript API Library): https://axios.nuxtjs.org/
